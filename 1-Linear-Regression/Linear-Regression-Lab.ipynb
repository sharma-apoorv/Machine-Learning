In this model, we assume access to an \"oracle\" that can evaluate the objective function and its gradient at a particular point, without further knowledge of the nature of the function. Contrast this with *parameter-based* optimization in which the objective function has some \"parameters\" that we know something about (for example, a quadratic function in which we know the Hessian and gradient)."

If the gradient of the function is sufficiently smooth, and the step-size is small enough, then gradient descent will converge to an optimum at rate $O\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. We will implement this algorithm on some simple examples."
